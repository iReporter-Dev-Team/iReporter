## Project Description

### Our problem statement

Corruption has been a huge bane in Africaâ€™s development. African countries have seen the the need develop and localise solutions to curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter.

### Our solution
 
iReporter is a web application that enables any citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of the appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also make reports on things that need government intervention.

## Project Implementation

### Technology used

The front-end is written in React.js with a Ruby on Rails server at the back-end deployed to Heroku. Authentication is handled using internal Rails tools with users being assigned the appropriate credentials on signup and then being directed to the relevant part of the site. Email and SMS notifications are handled using Action mailer and Twilio respectively.

### Planning
 
We did research on the issue both locally and online to gain a proper understanding of the user stories for both types of user - The reporter (citizen) and the admin (policy maker). We created wireframes and a more high fidelity in version in Figma before we began building.

### Methodology

We adopted an agile methodology with 3 day sprints and daily standups to sync our progress.
